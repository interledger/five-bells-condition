 * Crypto-condition.

 * condition as a simple hashlock.

 * However, this means that a condition only carries the absolute minimum
 * information required. It does not tell you anything about its structure.

 * the parts of the fulfillment that are known up-front, e.g. public keys), the
 * maximum fulfillment size, the set of features used and the condition type.
 *
 * This information is just enough that an implementation can tell with
 * certainty whether it would be able to process the corresponding fulfillment.
